  "description": "The smell of turkey wafting through the air has long passed. You’re waking up from your food coma, in-fact you woke up so early that you were enjoying the post-turkey day retail sales.  After a long day of shopping its time to fly!  Join the Albuquerque controller team while we carry on our tradition of the annual Stuff the Albu-Turkey event! From the top-down, we will be providing outstanding ATC service at both Phoenix Sky Harbor (KPHX) and Albuquerque International Sunport (KABQ) for a fun evening of Black Friday flying!  Friday, November 29, 2019 – 2359z – 0400z.",
